# Controls ⌨️

Remember all `key`` controls can be rebinded in the [Key Actions](https://github.com/lucas-goldner/FlutterShow/blob/main/lib/presentation/config/key_actions.dart) enum!<br/>
If you want to change the default behaviour of a mouse click, you can edit that [here](https://github.com/lucas-goldner/FlutterShow/blob/9920f20ac673d3eed0b4eeacc1932d55d4a7d495/lib/presentation/view/presentation_slides.dart#L42).

## Default controls

### Mouse:

- Primary Mouse click -> Go to next slide / `animationStep`.
- Secondary Mouse click -> Go to last slide.

### Keys:

- D, Arrow Right, Arrow Up -> Go to next slide / `animationStep`.
- S, Arrow Left, Arrow Down -> Go to last slide / `animationStep`.
- M -> Opens menu.
- O -> Toggles mouse visibility.
