# FlutterShow⚡️ Docs - Presentations in Flutter

FlutterShow Docs was build to demonstrate all components of FlutterShow Base and FlutterShow Keynote.
It also describes how FlutterShow is intended to be used and has a tutorial and live demo showcasing it.

And it is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator,
because I wanted to try that out for a long time now and this project actually could use good documentation.

Interestingly enough I also used Flutter Element Embedding here to showcase my project so that was also something I learned through this project.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
